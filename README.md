# chess-engine
A simple chess engine written in C++. Currently can track the board status using
bitboards, and play a simple game. 

### To-do list:
1. Implement additional rules including en passant, castling through check, stalemate,
and double check.
2. Clean up code, add additional comments and redesign if needed.
3. Add evaluation metric.
