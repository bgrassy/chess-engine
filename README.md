# chess-engine
A simple chess engine written in C++. Currently can track the board status using
bitboards, and play a simple game. 

### To-do list:
1. Clean up code, add additional comments and redesign if needed.
2. Add evaluation metric.
3. Add draw by repetition, 50 move rule, and any remaining rules.
